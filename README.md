# gmail-label-to-file
This apps script function for Gmail will take every email labelled with a certain label and write them to a text document with minor formatting.

The purpose of this was to have a easily readable collection of all them emails between my High School band over the years without having to view each email individually. It can be repurposed for other labelled collections of emails.
